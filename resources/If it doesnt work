If chromedriver.exe doesn't work you have to make sure the version you have matches the version you are trying to control

go to the chrome menu, then click on help >, then About Google Chrome, to see which version of chrome you have.

Go to http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads to download the chrome driver that matches

Replace the chomedriver.exe file with the newer one
